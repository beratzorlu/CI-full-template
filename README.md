Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This is a practice project created as a part of Code Institute's full stack software development curriculum. The core purpose of it is to understand GIT and apply it in communicating with GitHub. While the project itself is fairly simplistic, it allows the student to incrementally build upon necessary technologies involved in uploading code to the cloud. 

Publishing code on the Internet is an important aspect of deploying software. Therefore, it is always beneficial for the student to have a firm understanding of processes that allow code to be uploaded to the Internet. This is also important in instilling the importance of collaborative work environments in the professional career of a software developer to the students of the programme.
